# libfprint
This folder will hopefully contain a patched version of libfprint, which works with the devices mentioned.

# To-do:
- choose a naming scheme
- what not to leave for completeness
### Next up:
- suspend, resume
- cancel
- what remains in class init
- using glib functions
- error handling
- memory checking
- general cleanup
- storage of pairing data
